    <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/about/starfish.jpg">
    <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX, but I'm Mexican at heart.</p>
    <p>Here is when I went snorkeling in the beautiful reefs of Cozumel, Mexico.</p>
    <p>My goal is to move to Norway one day and live close to the Fjords!</p>

    <h2>Favorite Meals</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/about/enchiladas.jpg">
    <p>Green Enchiladas easily takes the crown for my favorite meal.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I highly recommend Yellow Curry, Fetuccine Alfredo, or Carnita Tacos (avocado, lime, cilantro, diced onions, and green salsa are mandatory!)</p>

    <h2>What I Listen To</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/about/nin.jpg">
    <p>I enjoy a wide variety of music, but my favorite bands right now are Nine Inch Nails and Tool.</p>
    <p>If you pass me the aux cord, I'll respect everyone's ears and put on some Royel Otis or Milky Chance.</p>

    <h2>Games I Play</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/about/guitarhero.jpg">
    <p>Rhythm games are my favorite genre of game and have heavily shaped my taste in music.</p>
    <p>I don't play Guitar Hero as much as I did back then, but I've been playing Arcaea quite a lot recently. I'm hoping to get into Dance Dance Revolution one day!</p>
    <p>I'm also very fond of Pokemon, Minecraft and FPS games like Fortnite or Call of Duty.</p>
