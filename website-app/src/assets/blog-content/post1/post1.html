    <h3>This is my first blog post, thanks for checking it out!</h3>
    <p>The whole process took me about a week and a half. 
        This is incredibly fast considering I've never touched Angular or Azure before starting!
        So how did I do it? I'd like to introduce my good friend Chad Jippity (Chat-GPT 4o).</p>
    <p>It's important to go over my motivations for using Jippity to develop my website.
        I've played around with Jippity in terms of helping me conjure up snippets of code,
        and I'm well aware of its limitations that only allow it to be effective when dealing with
        small snippets. Fortunately, nodejs frameworks are all about bringing together separate components,
        so I saw this as a great opportunity to see how Jippity performs at developing a medium sized website
        by focusing on indiviual components at a time.</p>
    <p>I believe that it's vital for those in the IT industry to have some sort of personal website, and I am
        absolutely not proficient in front-end development, but I wanted to at least have some exposure to the tools
        that most job listings have in their "wish list" for candidates.</p>
    <p>As an appetizer to one of the struggles I faced, Jippity (as of August 2024) is not aware of Angular v17,
        which is the exact version of Angular I used. This forced me to trust my own judgement and do 
        additional research when things to south to ensure that development goes smoothly.</p>
    <p>In this post, I'll go over my prompts, Jippity's responses, and how my primitive knowledge of
        HTML and CSS saved me from initial deployment to a state where I can develop the content of the website
        at my own leisure without consulting Jippity any further.</p>

    <h3>Deployment on Microsoft Azure</h3>
    <p>A little fun fact is that I originally intended on using AWS for deployment and CI/CD. I used it for my
        university capstone project and I wanted more practice. However, I had a lot of issues trying to log in
        and eventually realized that I already used my phone number when making my team's AWS account, and AWS
        has a strong rule about multiple accounts. After a frustrating night, I decided to try out Azure, so I 
        asked Jippity if it would cost me anything before proceeding.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, setting up a static website on Azure is BY FAR way easier than on AWS. For reference,
        You would have to use: S3, Route 53, Cloudfront, Certificate Manager, and CodePipeline to deploy a 
        static website on a secure custom domain. On Azure, all of this is done in "Static Website App" without
        having to open up different services and cross-reference configurations to make it all work.</p>
    <p>Moving on, getting a simple "hello world" html page set up on my domain was light work. So I moved on
        by asking Jippity to set up a simple hello-world component to get familiar with deployment.</p>

    <p>At this point, everything seemed to be going smoothly!</p>

    <h3>Slight Tangent With Version Issues</h3>
    <p>It did not, in fact, go smoothly. I was getting strange errors that seemed incomprehensible. Thankfully,
        Jippity correctly assessed that this was a versioning issue and that I had to install the right versions
        to make Angular v17 work.</p>
    <p>Okay, so to make Angular v17 work, I had to install the required versions found
