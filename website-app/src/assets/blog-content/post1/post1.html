    <h3>This is my first blog post, thanks for checking it out!</h3>
    <p>The whole process took me about a week and a half. 
        This is incredibly fast considering I've never touched Angular or Azure before starting!
        So how did I do it? I'd like to introduce my good friend Chad Jippity (Chat-GPT 4o).</p>
    <p>It's important to go over my motivations for using Jippity to develop my website.
        I've played around with Jippity in terms of helping me conjure up snippets of code,
        and I'm well aware of its limitations that only allow it to be effective when dealing with
        small snippets. Fortunately, nodejs frameworks are all about bringing together separate components,
        so I saw this as a great opportunity to see how Jippity performs at developing a medium sized website
        by focusing on indiviual components at a time.</p>
    <p>I believe that it's vital for those in the IT industry to have some sort of personal website, and I am
        absolutely not proficient in front-end development, but I wanted to at least have some exposure to the tools
        that most job listings have in their "wish list" for candidates. So instead of having someone else make this
        website for me, I decided to try it out myself and see how far I could push AI with this.</p>
    <p>As an appetizer to one of the struggles I faced, Jippity (as of August 2024) is not aware of Angular v17,
        which is the exact version of Angular I used. This forced me to trust my own judgement and do 
        additional research when things go south to ensure that development goes smoothly.</p>
    <p>In this post, I'll go over my prompts, Jippity's responses, and how my primitive knowledge of
        HTML and CSS saved me from initial deployment to a state where I can develop the content of the website
        at my own leisure without consulting Jippity any further.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-bubble">
    <h3>Deployment on Microsoft Azure</h3>
    <p>A little fun fact is that I originally intended on using AWS for deployment and CI/CD. I used it for my
        university capstone project and I wanted more practice. However, I had a lot of issues trying to log in
        and eventually realized that I already used my phone number when making my team's AWS account, and AWS
        has a strong rule about multiple accounts. After a frustrating night, I decided to try out Azure, so I 
        asked Jippity if it would cost me anything before proceeding.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/costs.png">
    <p>Surprisingly, setting up a static website on Azure is BY FAR way easier than on AWS. For reference,
        You would have to use: S3, Route 53, Cloudfront, Certificate Manager, and CodePipeline to deploy a 
        static website on a secure custom domain. On Azure, all of this is done in "Static Website App" without
        having to open up different services and cross-reference configurations to make it all work.</p>
    <p>Moving on, getting a simple "hello world" html page set up on my domain was light work. So I moved on
        by asking Jippity to set up a simple hello-world component to get familiar with deployment.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/commands.png">
    <p>At this point, everything seemed to be going smoothly!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-bubble">
    <h3>Slight Tangent With Version Issues</h3>
    <p>It did not, in fact, go smoothly. I was getting strange errors that seemed incomprehensible. Thankfully,
        Jippity correctly assessed that this was a versioning issue and that I had to install the right versions
        to make Angular v17 work.</p>
    <p>Thanks to a stack overflow post, I learned that the required versions are found 
        <a class="constrast-1" href="https://angular.dev/reference/versions">here</a>, but the bulk of the struggle
        was uninstalling old versions of nodejs even though I had installed newer versions (and it insisted on
        using the old versions for reasons that are beyond me). Once again, Jippity
        saved the day and I was able to uninstall the old version. Hooray!</p>
    <p>Now that the hello-world component was displaying properly, it was time to see how 'ng serve' refreshed
        live during development... but no matter what I did or how detailed I was with Jippity, nothing worked.
        After a few hours of more frustration, I gave up and installed everything on Powershell instead of WSL 2.
        Lo and behold, it worked for reasons that are again beyond me, but at least it works and that's what matters.</p>
    <p>It was time for deployment, so I pushed everything to GitHub to have everything deployed. Surprise surprise,
        GitHub actions failed.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/nodeversion.png">
    <p>Thankfully, I found the culprit. I truly believe that I would have gone insane if it weren't for the fact
        that I had encountered this issue before and knew to change 'uses: actions/setup-node@v3' to use 'v4' instead.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this entire process took a full day to resolve and I am now very careful to check for version
        requirements before touching any tool.</p>

    <h3>Getting On With The Visuals</h3>
    <p>Now that I had automatic deployment set up, I was ready to begin. With Jippity, you have to be as specific
        as humanly possible, because otherwise you're going to get something that looks... less than ideal.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/aiwebsiteprompt.png">
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/aihome.png">
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/aiabout.png">
    <p>Here, the solid color is meant to be a placeholder for a background image that you're meant to choose yourself.
        However, I have several problems with this method of "do what you want" prompting. Opening index.html didn't
        give me any indication that I was supposed to scroll down besides the browser's scroll bar. This is also
        not scalable at all, so adding content to the website would be a pain for someone that only has these files
        to work with. Sure, AI might be great, but the larger of a website or project it has to work with, the more
        unstable it gets since it starts getting into specifics. This is why I chose to focus on small components at
        a time, and even then, things can get quite complex depending on what you want.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/settings.png">
    <p>The settings button is a good example of something that turned out to be more complex than I thought it would be.
        Overall, it isn't too bad. The
        <a href="https://github.com/Czatar/Personal-Website/blob/main/website-app/src/app/settings/settings.component.ts">
        settings.component.ts</a> file is only about 100 lines long. This controls the site theme, font size, and
        background opacity. And just when I thought I was getting the hang of CSS, it turns out that calc() operations do
        not support arithmetic with hex colors. Oh well. </p>
    <p>When giving the settings buttons images, I was also struggling with making it look good on my phone, as the
        images would get cut off from the sides. Jippity was trying to be smart and trying to make me use webkit tools, 
        but I got lazy and simply made the menu icon larger and that did the trick!</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/glow.png">
    <p>For the rainbow effect seen on the header/footer, this is what Jippity suggested at first. This was absolutely
        not going to fly and it felt very scuffed. After a bit of back-and-forth discussion with Jippity, I was able
        to convince it to give me Typescript code to manually set the intervals, which is much easier to adjust!
        At this point, I was convinced that Jippity alone cannot threaten any jobs. Even though the Settings were in
        their own component, it required interactions between it and other components as well as the global style.css file,
        so it makes sense that our friend Jippity was starting to struggle. FOr every "solution" it gave me, there were at
        least a few errors that I had to poke it again for. There was also the issue where Jippity would assume that
        I wouldn't have a particular file, and I would have to provide the current state of that file so that Jippity
        could fill in what's missing to make something work. It was tedious at this point, but still manageable.</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/about.png">
    <p>The most vital advantage I had was the ability to show it pictures of my website so I can properly convey
        what I'm looking at and how I want it fixed. Jippity did a much better job when it had something concrete to
        work with.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-bubble">
    <h3>Setting Up Blogs and Addressing Refresh Errors</h3>
    <p>This was the most intimidating part to set up and also the part where Jippity was the most helpful.
        Since I didn't want to make a component for every single blog post that I'm going to make, Jippity suggested
        that I use lazy loading and a sub-router for blogs and a service to get every post, which was the most
        impressive suggestion Jippity has made to make adding to blogs scalable!</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/routing.png">
    <p>Here's me struggling with Jippity to get routing to work correctly. There were so many new files that I had
        to take a moment to read through them to understand how it all works. Thankfully, Jippity nailed the HTML
        injection and a simple way to get the CSS to work for any given HTML blog post. However, this was when I
        discovered a glaring issue: refreshing on any page returns a blank page (and a 404 error on Azure).</p>
    <img src="/assets/blog-content/post1/routing.png">
    <p>Jippity was really starting to get on my nerves after hours of looking at this problem. Since Jippity
        rightfully turns to the Angular documentation that addresses this issue, the sole reason I turn to
        Jippity is because documentation itself isn't written in a helpful manner to beginners. Every time I
        would provide Jippity with screenshots of the Network tab or other debugging information, it would 
        suggest that I make sure I have base href set to "/", which I did, so it almost felt like it was taunting me.
        By some miracle,
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73535177/how-do-i-locate-my-staticwebapp-config-json-in-azure-devops-release-deploy-azure">
        I found a helpful answer on Stack Overflow</a> and all reloading issues were resolved. At this point, I could
        finally declare my website finished, and I will (hopefully) never have to wrestle with Jippity over developing
        websites again!</p>
