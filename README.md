# Personal-Website
Here's where I store my personal website! I'll use this as personal web-dev practice.

Since I already have experience with React and AWS from university projects, I wanted to try out different tools this time. I'm using Angular v17 as the framework and Azure to host the website on my domain: [carloszatarain.com](https://carloszatarain.com), complete with automatic deployment from GitHub.
